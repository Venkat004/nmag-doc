What the field theory specification language ultimately should
eventually be able to look like (toy example, not dealing with all the
subtleties involved in the computation of the demagnetizing field!):

micromagnetism=physics("""
[charge-from-magnetism]   = <rho_m || d/dxj M(j)> + <rho_m || D/Dxj M(j)>, j:3
[charge-from-potential]   = <d/dxj rho_m || d/dxj phi>, 
[field-from-potential]    = -<H_demag(j) || d/dxj phi>
[exchange-from-magnetism] = -J*<d/dxj H_exch(k) || d/dxj M(k)>, j:3, k:3

rho_m   = [charge-from-magnetism]*M
phi     = [charge-from-potential]\rho_m
H_demag = [field-from-potential]*phi
H_exch  = [exchange_from_magnetism]*M

# Do we have to introduce a special notation for site-local
# operations? If not, that would be preferable.

H_anis(j)  = a*M(j)*M(j)-b*M(3)*M(3), j:3
H_eff(j)   = H_anis(j) + H_demag(j) + H_exch(j)
dM/dt(j)   =    c1*epsilon(j,k,l)*M(k)*H_eff(l)
              + c2*epsilon(j,k,l)*M(k)*epsilon(l,p,q)*M(p)*H_eff(q)

# Note: /dt in a field name is treated in a special way! This
# indicates that we will use time integration!
 
# "Division from the left via \ notation" - use solver
# Unresolved question: this is an anonymous way to specify a solver.
# We also need an explicit one so that we can use a name handle on the 
# solver to modify/specify/tweak parameters
