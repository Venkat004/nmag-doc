Grammar for local field equations.

Rules:

 * Every line will be instantiated with if(have_field1 && have_field2 && ...) { <body> }
 
 * All joker field indices will be made to run over the whole range,
   using Einstein summation convention. Range has to be provided!

Examples:

========
%local Some_Tensor(3,3),len_M_sq;
%ranges i:3, j:3, k:3, l:3, m:3;

dM_dt(i) <-   alpha * eps(i,j,k) * M(j) * H_total(k) 
            + beta * eps(i,j,k) * eps(k,l,m) * M(j) * M(l) * H_total(m)
            + gamma * M(i)*(M(j)*M(j)-len_M_sq);

========

Rules (roughly):

* Statements are terminated by a semicolon.

* We have %local lines introducing local variables, either tensors or
  scalars. 

* Assignments use <- as an assignment sign. Permissible lvalues
  are tensors.

* We will always fold out all Tensor(j,k) to concrete index instantiations!
