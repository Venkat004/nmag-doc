    <h1>Making a shared object library that uses OCaml</h1>

<h2>Some blurb about programming philosophy</h2>

<P>One issue with every programming language is interoperability with
existing code. Virtually anything that anyone might consider a serious
programming language can at least call into C. Some also provide means
so that C can execute a callback into the high level language, and so
on. The ladder of increasing inter-operability roughly looks as
follows - where "possible" always means that (1) one can do it, (2) it
is easy to do, and (3) it is well documented and supported, and the
developers give guarantees that there will not be any surprise changes
concerning he interface.
</P>

<P>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to call C from the language.</li>

<li>It is possible to runtime-link and call C shared object libraries.</li>

<li>It is possible to register callbacks from C into the language.</li>

<li>Calling into C and from there back into the language recursively
"just works as it should". (There are some call stack issues here.)</li>

<li>It is possible to start the high-level language from within an own C 
<code>main()</code> function.</li>

<li>It is possible to put code written in the high-level language into
libraries that are callable as C shared object libraries.
</li>

<li>...and this works with the standard C compiler on your machine (so
that it even works if some other system with more misguided design
wants to provide a special compiler wrapper - like MPI's <code>mpicc</code>).
</li>

<li>...and it is reasonable and easy to have multiple C-callable .so
libraries that are to be used in conjunction utilize code written in
the extension language.
</li>

<li>One can start the high-level language's
read-eval-print-loop/command-line-interface from within C.
</li>

</ol>
</P>

<P>The underlying issue with many of those points is that, speaking in
terms of inter-operability, a design of a language or system must be
considered as broken if it wants to place itself on the top, without
giving the advanced user all the tools and documentation and
guarantees he or she needs to put something else on the top. The
language or system XYZ may be as great as it can be, if there is
another unrelated outstandingly useful system ABC that also considers
itself the most important thing in the world, this will give people
who want to combine ABC and XYZ into one program a pretty hard time.
</P>

<h2>Objective Caml</h2>

<P>While OCaml does not satisfy all our interoperability wishes, it
still does far better in this respect than many other
systems. Nevertheless, the procedure of building an ocaml-using C
shared object library that can be used from within C (or any other
language with a foreign function interface) is slightly tricky and
could need a bit more documentation. Here is what I did, and what I
found out.
</P>

<h3>The code</h3>

<P>According to the OCaml documentation, we are supposed to use the
function <code>caml_startup(char **argv)</code> to start the OCaml
runtime system. This is supposed to be passed an argument-vector from
which it will initialize <code>Sys.argv</code> and maybe even do a few
other things. Fine-tuning a system's behaviour which one might want to
embed into another system via command line parameters can easily
become a nightmare if more than one of the components wants to do
that, and they barf or even conflict on one another's arguments. One
alternative that is just as bad in terms of C stack usage as command
args, but otherwise more flexible, is the usage of environment
variables. So, let us for now suppose that for enhanced flexibility,
we have all the args that are for OCaml given in one string which
knows &gt;'<code>\ </code>'&lt; escape sequences and
&gt;<code>"'</code>&lt; strings. This we break at whitespace to get
individual arguments. We furthermore also expect/allow
<code>argv[0]</code> to be specified in this way as well - this is not
obvious. Strictly speaking, this issue is unrelated to what we want to
do, but let us just repair this problem as well while we are at
it. Believe me, you will find it quite convenient to just pass a
<code>getenv()</code> string rather than a C <code>argv</code>. (Note
ad the code: isn't it sad how we have to bend over backwards to do
with POSIX regexps what would be a matter of a single line of code in
Perl? And furthermore, while being quite cautious here, I am not even
100% sure that there may not be a bug in the code, maybe even with
security implications. Ah, the fun of writing C code. But with
OCaml-written C libraries, we will not have to do that much longer
anyway. :-) Just kidding.)
</P>

<P>The code for this is in 
<a href="caml-startup.c"><code>caml-startup.c</code></a>.
</P>

<P>(A side note: People sometimes ask me whether it is really
necessary that I mark things like own world-visible functions, patches
to the Linux kernel, and stuff like that, with my Initials
<code>tf</code>. The only reason why I do this is that I do not
consider myself so authoritative that I would name a library like,
say, '<code>libphysics</code>', or a global function like
<code>rule_the_world()</code>, at least as long as I have a feeling
that somebody else might want to use the same name for something quite
different. So, all this is merely to provide sort of an own
namespace. Even if this does not avoid occasional conflicts (never had
one, though), it's much easier to automatically search for problems
with such conventions in place.)
</P>

<P>Besides this, we need a ML code file. In principle, this could be
empty (up to a comment, of course, telling us what it is), that is
<em>contain no code at all</em>. We will put a single line of code
in there to just show that OCaml was initialized correctly.
</P>

<P>That code is in <a href="caml-init.ml"><code>caml-init.ml</code></a>.

<P>The issue with making the location of <code>caml-in-lib.so</code>
known to the linker is not yet quite that sexy. But at least, we see
that it works this way. Now, let us do something slightly more
sophisticated: use <code>dlopen()</code> and friends.

<P>Now, it would be terrific when we could also load other OCaml
modules into our OCaml library at run-time. I do not know whether this
works, presumably not. Anyway, now that I'm typing this, it is almost
3:00 in the morning, and hence I will investigate this at some other
occasion...
