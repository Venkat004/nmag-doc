Since the region  can be an arbitrary piece of the material under study, the integrands must be equal at almost every point. If the material under study is a slab of a homogeneous substance, then , s, and are independent of the position x, and we obtain the heat equation

u_t = k \laplace u

where k = sigma/rho c. the constant c is te specific heat capacity, rho is the density, sigma is the thermal conductivity. Ordinary substances have values of k ranging from about 5 to 9000 cm2/gm (see table).
