This CD should be bootable on any sufficiently modern PC (including
laptops) and contains a complete Linux operating system.

This system was set up containing the first public release of the
{\Nmag} micromagnetic simulation system developed at the University of
Southampton.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Booting from this CD does not install any software on
harddrive, so this is a safe method to test-drive {\Nmag}. This also
means, however, that the system will start up noticeably slower than a
harddisk installation, as loading from CD-ROM is comparatively slow.

\item The {\Nmag} web page is {\tt http://nmag.soton.ac.uk}, 
 and the developer team can be reached under the E-mail
 {\tt nmag@soton.ac.uk}.

\item The {\Nmag} documentation also can be accessed directly on this CD,
 without booting.

\item This CD may also be useful for other purposes, such as to rescue 
data from a broken PC.
