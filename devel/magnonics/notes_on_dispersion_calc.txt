Here are some mails with notes on computation of dispersion relations.
There are some comments from me (Matteo) and what I learnt (mainly from Exeter)
and Atul and his experience in his own research field.
=======

Hi Atul, (Matteo)

thanks again for your reply below.

Matteo, I think we have now to sets of useful notes (Atul's below, and your comments that you did sent to Anil before). I suppose we should merge them at some point tobecome part of a future manual or something like that.  Can you keep both emails in a safe place?

Cheers,

Hans

It is due to the sampling frequency being too low, i.e. the signal (the discrete data that you are Fourier transforming) has frequency contents beyond (i.e. >) the 'Nyquist frequency' which is half the sampling frequency. The DFT 'folds back' at the Nyquist point and 'corrupts' the < f_Nyq region transforms. It is a bit of an art to sort this out - there are various options:
