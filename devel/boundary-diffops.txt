We have to pay more attention to the specification of how to deal with
boundaries in differential operators.

What actually is a boundary?

Easy: for every DOF, we know across which simplex faces it will
"vanish", so in order to get boundary dofs, we just select thse for
which dof.dof_vanishes_across <> [].

div M vs. Div M
===============

Notational suggestion:

div M: "<rho || d/dxj M[any](j)>"  = "<rho || d/dxj M(j)>" 

Div M: "<rho || D/Dxj M[bdy](j)>"


rho = laplace phi
=================

Notational suggestion:

"<d/dxj rho || d/dxj phi[any]> + <D/Dxj rho[bdy] || d/dxj phi>;(L||R)=(*||*) , j:3 "

~~~~~~~~~~~~

d/dxj = "normal 'volume' derivative"

D/Dxj = "surface jump derivative"

X[any]: synonymous to X
X[vol]: volume nodes only (i.e. those that do not jump!)
X[bdy]: boundary nodes only (i.e. do contribs only for 
	those nodes and simplex faces that have a "dof vanishes" 
	jump!)

(L||R)=(*||*)

Specification whether we want "short vector" 
(boundary dofs only) or "long vector" indices.

* = all
otherwise, list materials, e.g. (L||R) = (*||m_Fe,m_Dy)

--> left: full length, right: only jumping DOFs in Dy/Fe.

Note: there is an issue here with boundaries for "middle" fields. 
In my opinion, we should just not allow that... middle fields always
will have to be "full" fields.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extensions:

(1) (L||R)=... is to be made just one among a number of other similar
"extra matrix amendments". These are given, in arbitrary order,
after the semicolon.

Others will include:

 ( )  rho[bdy] = phi[bdy]

Put 1s on the diagonal for corresponding rho/phi boundary/boundary DOFs.
(Used to solve D.B.C. linear systems!)

 ( ) gauge_fix:phi or gauge_fix:phi[body=2]

Means to look at the components of connection and modify those for the
given bodies (which should be just the ones which do not carry any
Dirichlet B.C.) by adding Phi_j=0 somewhere in there. This will remove
the gauge freedom from the Laplace operator and turn it into a
solvable system.

 ( ) periodic:H_demag_Fe

Means to use mesh periodicity information on the corresponding field
(as always, may include body specifiers!)


(2) The specifiers [body] and [boundary] need further extension:
    it should be possible to say [body=2] or [boundary=2/3]!
