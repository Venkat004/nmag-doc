Roadmap for bringing parallelization up-to-date & including time-stepping:

[ ] Sundials Problem/Bug: When we rebuild the Jacobian (which may be distributed),
    we presently zero it only on the master! Not right!

[ ] Need to re-include intensive parameters (for thermal effects: time!)

[ ] Jacobi preconditioning has to be wrapped into the linalg_machine
    for parallelization. (Otherwise, we can only parallelize the computation
    of the RHS, not the equally time-consuming preconditioner computation!)

[ ] Timing and other new opcodes must be parallelized (they actually are
    executed only on master though. On slaves, they are a NOP.)

[ ] Every machine must have a "local copy" of the primary field vectors, 
    as we need this for distributed re-setup of the Jacobian.
