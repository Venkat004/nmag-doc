Note to nmag users: please read carefully through this list of
presently unresolved issues. If you plan to use nmag for exotic
applications, you may run into these problems, possibly without
noticing.

=== Periodic Boundary Conditions ===

Bugs:

[ ] probing H_demag in exterior space seems to produce bad results if the
    probe is in the plane of a triangle (I suppose the Lindholm formula
    somewhere produces NAN in the computation of the space angle associated
    to the triangle.)

[ ] probing H_demag in exterior space: does not work in any satisfactory
    way for periodic systems yet!

Open issues:

[ ] We presumably should re-check the mathematics in bem_stubs.c: are
    the positions of displaced objects/displaced observers and the
    linear transformations applied to the displaced object's coordinates
    done right?

=== Langevin dynamics related ===

When we simulate thermal effects, advance_time() cannot use sundials'
CVODE, as this will get badly confused by a random field. So, we use
Heun's method (in effect, Runge-Kutta RK2) instead, with a fixed
time-step.

Bugs:

[ ] If the final time given cannot be reached with an integer number 
    of time steps, final time will not be the given one, but the
    largest time that is smaller than the given final time and an
    integer multiple of the thermal dt.

[ ] When we use thermal effects in conjunction with periodic boundary
    conditions that require identification of degrees of freedom
    (i.e. the magnetic material wraps around a topological circle),
    we can be sure that dm_dt will be the same at periodically
    identified sites. However, we cannot exclude with 100% confidence
    that numerical drift, say, produced because numbers are added in
    different order for periodically identified sites, will not cause
    mirror-image magnetizations to eventually drift apart. When using
    sundials for time integration (i.e. when we do the simulation
    without taking care of thermal effects), this is not a problem, 
    because then, make sure that mirage dofs are properly removed in
    an additional intermediate wrapping step.

    Suggested proper resolution: reducing and expanding mirage DOFs
    presumably should not be part of sundials, but be handled at the
    level of the linalg_machine (LAM).

=== Grammar related ===

Problems:

[ ] At present, we internally use two different grammars/internal
representations to specify boundary degrees of freedom. The underlying
problem is that the issue of dealing with boundaries appeared in two
different contexts which warranted slightly different approaches, but
eventually these grew together. At present, we use boundary
specification conversion functions which unfortunately are not
faithful (i.e. there are situations when we have to map specs from one
form to another form which is unable to express as much detail!)

What we will need (in the long run) is an unified way to specify what
boundaries a degree of freedom belongs to.
