These files aim to establish a procedure for creating Python extension
modules in OCaml. The current aim is that the following commands

    python generate_makefile.py
    make byte
    make testbyte

result in the squares of the numbers from 0 to 14 to be printed.

The above demonstrates how it works for byte compiled Ocaml.

For natively compiled OCaml it only works with ocaml 3.11.0 on Linux,
as demonstrated by the following:

    python generate_makefile.py
    make native
    make test

For quickly checking that everything works, just type

    make

which removes any output files, regenerates the makefile, compiles and
tests the bytecode version, and compiles and tests the native version.
