Our operator specification language and framework allows to provide
"middle field factors", which occur e.g. when we construct general
laplace operators that correspond to dissipation problems with
spatially varying "conductivity", also given by a field.

At present, there is no general support for this in the linalg_machine
framework, but we have to use ad-hoc code changes to play with such
operators. 

What we will need in the longer run is the separation of matrix
creation from matrix population/repopulation. This would not only
allow us to flexibly re-generate some matrix operators such as a
dynamically conductivity-dependent laplacian, but we might also get
interesting opportunities to play nice things with "setup-on-demand"
lazy evaluation of operator matrices. (Presumably, the real benefits
of the lazy aspects might be rather limited though.)

This should (and easily can) go hand in hand with the parallelization
of matrix setup, which we eventually want to do anyway.
