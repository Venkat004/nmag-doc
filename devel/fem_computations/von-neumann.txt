Ad implementation of Von Neumann Boundary Conditions:

Typical situation: a magnetic medium shares a boundary with a
non-magnetic medium. The jump in magnetization across the interface
enters as a magnetic surface charge contribution.

Question: is this scenario generic enough to cover all relevant NBC
cases via generalization?

General pattern seems to be:

When allocating DOFs, and going through all simplices, there may be
some DOF types which could be subject to NBC "face splitting" - like
magnetization. How to determine when face splitting has to happen?

 * If a DOF candidate sits at a site such that the mother simplex and
   one of the face-adjacent simplices(!) that would share this DOF
   have regions (region1,region2), and that is a registered boundary,
   the DOF has to be split into a region-1 and a region-2 part.

 * DOFs that are eligible for NBC splitting follow a special convention
   concerning their indices: the leading index they carry will always be the
   body number they are associated to!

   Hence, it will be ("M",[|2,0|]) for the x-component of the magnetization
   associated to Body 2.

   Note that a given DOF may want to be present only for certain simplex
   regions: we should not allocate a magnetization for the outer space!

 * If we do it this way, how are we supposed to know which faces and
   DOFs make NBCs? Easy: when allocating DOFs, we need a post-processing
   step that once more runs through all simplices, and all faces, and
   checks for NBC interfaces.

   What do we record for any NBC interface found?

   - the simplex
   - the face number (= number of the opposing vertex)
   - All DOFs, together with their element functions
     for the corresponding simplex, that contribute.


================================================

Actually, the idea of enforcing region-dependent names for DOFs of
fields that have NBCs may not be so bright after all. Rationale:
consider having a constant-potential and constant-surface-charge
conductive ball. The electric potential will have DBC along some
boundaries and NBC along others. Now, in such a situation we might get
name splitting even for DBC regions(?). But maybe I'm just confused
here.

So, how to deal with this? Introducing name groups (i.e. making the
mapping from DOF to name multi-valued) may come to one's mind. This
presumably is not a good idea. Rather, we just need more flexibility
with the dof-naming. Just let the user specify.

The general treatment of NBCs for the Laplace problem is somewhat
hairy. Note, however, that we only need something far more simpler in
our case: surface divergencies of vector fields - e.g. the magnetism.

So, we can handle this in a cavalier way by just

(1) telling mesh_allocate_dof to do DOF splitting for boundaries with
    surface charges.

(2) Allowing an extra parameter in our div-matrix-maker that allows us
    to scan for and handle surface charges.
