Goals:

-global configuration file in ?/nmag/nmag.conf

-user configuration file ~/.nmag.conf

Once we run a script, we'd like it to do the same thing
reproducibly. That means, we need to write a local configuration file
for every run (if it doesn't exist) that contains all relevant
settings, and read this file if it exists already.

(The same applies for nmesh parameters, and logging parameters.)





places to configure stuff:

the nsimrc file for 

global data
-library locations such as sundials
-flags for c compiler 

per run data
-output directory? (remove -> too complex)
-global log level

The logging config file (usually in the nmag directory). The location
is specified in the nsimrc file (so the user can modify the location
to provide their own).


options for command line (overriding everything else)

-run ID
(-run directory)
-loglevel
