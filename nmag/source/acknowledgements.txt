We thank Thomas Schrefl, Wyn Williams, Michael Donahue, Richard
Boardman and JÃ¼rgen Zimmermann for useful discussion that have
supported the development of this tool.

Further acknowledgements go to the `Magpar`_ software and its main
author Werner Scholz. Magpar has provided a finite element
implementation of micromagnetics that has proved very useful in the
development of nmag. Special thanks to Werner Scholz who has discussed
various numerical problems with the nmag team in great depth.

We further thank the beta users for their helpful feedback, in
particular Michael Martens, David Vokoun, Niels Wiese, Gabriel David
Chaves O'Flynn and David Gonzales at the very early stages of the
project.
