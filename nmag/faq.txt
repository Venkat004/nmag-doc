.. _What is the difference between the OOMMF and |nmag| approach?:

What is the difference between the OOMMF and |nmag| approach?
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are several aspects. One important point is the calculation of
the demagnetisation field as this is a computationally very expensive step.

`OOMMF`_ is based on discretising space into small cuboids (often called
'finite differences'). One advantage of this method is that the demag
field can be computed very efficiently (via fast Fourier
transformation techniques). One disadvantage is that this methods
works less well (i.e. less accurately) if the geometry shape does not
align with a cartesian grid as the boundary then is represented as a
staircase pattern.

|nmag|'s finite elements discretise space into many small
tetrahedra. The corresponding approach towards the computation of the
demagnetisation field (which is the same as `Magpar`_'s method) is based
on the Fredkin and Koehler Hybrid Finite Element/Boundary Element
method. The advantage of this method (over OOMMF's approach) is that
curved and spherical geometries can be spatially resolved much more
accurately. However, this method of calculating the demagnetisation
field is less efficient than OOMMF's approach for thin films. (In
particular: memory requirements for the boundary element method grow
as the square of the number of surface points.) Note that for
simulation of thin films, the hybrid Finite Element/Boundary Element
(as used by |nmag| and `Magpar`_) is likely to require a lot of memory
(see :ref:`memory requirements of boundary element matrix`).

There are other points that are related to the fundamentally different
discretisation approach used to turn a field theory problem (with a
conceptually infinite number of degrees of freedom) into a finite
problem: OOMMF assumes the magnetisation in every cell to be constant
(with jumps at boundaries), while |Nmag| assumes magnetisation to be
continuous and vary linearly within cells (thus slightly violating the
constraint of constant magnitude within a cell of non-constant
magnetisation).

.. _... So, this means the major difference is "cubes" vs. "tetrahedra"?:

... So, this means the major difference is "cubes" vs. "tetrahedra"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Simplicial mesh discretisation is fundamentally different from
finite-difference discretisation. With OOMMF, say, magnetisation
degrees of freedom are associated with the centers(!) of the cells,
while with nmag, they are associated with corners. This conceptual
difference has many implications, e.g. for the question how to
conceptually deal with the exchange interaction between different
materials.

.. _Why do you have your own Python interpreter (=``nsim``)?:

Why do you have your own Python interpreter (=\ ``nsim``\ )?
------------------------------------------------------------

In order to provide the ability to run code in a distributed
environment (using MPI), we cannot use the standard Python
executable. (Technically speaking, a program started under MPI control
will receive extra MPI-related command line arguments which upset the
standard Python interpreter.) It so happens that -- by providing our
own Python executable which is called ``nsim`` -- we have easier
access to the low-level library of |nsim| which is written in
Objective Caml.

.. _What is nsim - I thought the package is called |nmag|?:

What is nsim - I thought the package is called |nmag|?
------------------------------------------------------

The :ref:`nsim library` is our general purpose multi-physics simulation
environment. The corresponding executable is started through the :ref:`nsim`
command. |Nmag| is a collection of scripts that provide micromagnetic
functionality on top of nsim. For this reason, nsim is being mentioned
a lot in the manual.

.. _How fast is nmag in comparison to magpar?:

How fast is nmag in comparison to magpar?
-----------------------------------------

Internally, some of the magpar and nmag core components are
structurally very similar. In particular, the time integration routine
is almost identical up to some philosophical issues such as how to
keep the length of the magnetisation vector constant, and whether or
not to use a symmetrical exchange matrix and a post-processing step
rather than combining these into an asymmetrical matrix, etc. The
actual wall clock time used will depend to a large degree on the
requested accuracy of the calculations (see :ref:`example timestepper
tolerances <example tolerances>`).

Given equivalent tolerance parameters, we have found (the
single-process version of) nmag to be about as fast as magpar. The
computation of an individual velocity dM/dt is very similar in nmag
and magpar, and about equally efficient. However, we observe that,
depending on the particular problem, subtle differences in the
philosophies underlying time integration can lead to noticeable
differences in the number of individual steps required to do some
particular simulation, which can be up to about 25% of simulation time
in either direction.

Setup time is a different issue: nmag derives its flexibility from
abstract approaches where magpar uses hard-coded compiled
functions. Where magpar uses a hand-coded Jacobian, nmag employs the
nsim core to symbolically compute the derivative of the equations of
motion. There is a trade-off: the flexibility of being able to
introduce another term into the equations of motion without having to
manually adjust the code for the Jacobian comes at a price in
execution time. Therefore, nmag's setup time at present is far larger
than magpar's. This can be alleviated to a considerable degree by
providing hard-coded "bypass routines" which can be used as
alternatives to the symbolically founded methods for special
situations that are frequently encountered (such as setting up a
Laplace operator matrix). Conceptually, it is easy to add support for
this but due to limited manpower, it has not happened yet.

In short: once the setup stage is over, nmag is about as fast as
magpar. Magpar's setup time, however, is much smaller. 
Magpar is also more efficient in memory usage.

.. _How do I start a time-consuming nmag run in the background?:

How do I start a time-consuming nmag run in the background?
-----------------------------------------------------------

While this is a Unix rather than a nmag issue, it comes up
sufficiently often to address it here.

Well-known techniques to run programs in the background are:

  - Using the "nohup" (no-hangup) command, as in::

      nohup nsim sphere1.py &

  - Using the at-daemon for scheduling of command execution at
    given times::

         at now
         warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
         at> nsim example1.py
         at> <EOT>
         job 2 at Fri Dec 14 12:08:00 2007

  - Manual daemonization by using a parent process which forks & exits,
    as in::

      perl -e 'exit(0) if fork(); exec "nsim sphere1.py"'

    (But if you know Unix to that degree, you presumably would
    not have asked in the first place.)

  - One of the most elegant ways to start a process in the background
    is by using the "screen" utility, which is installed on a number of
    Unix systems. With "screen", it becomes possible to start a text
    terminal session in such a way that one can "detach" from it while
    keeping the session alive, and even log out and log in again much
    later and from a different machine, re-attaching the terminal
    session and continuing work from the point where it was left.

    While it is a good idea to read the documentation, most basic usage of
    "screen" requires the knowledge of three commands only:
    
      - With "screen -R", one can re-attach to a running session,
        automatically creating a new one if none was created before.
    
      - Within a "screen" session, Control+a is a prefix keyboard command
        for controlling "screen": Pressing Control-a and then Control-d
        will detach the session.
    
      - Control-a ? will being up a help screen showing all "screen"
        keyboard commands.
    

.. comment:
       Furthermore, once one exits a shell which was started under "screen"
       control, this will kill the "screen" session as well.

Yes. See :ref:`Example: Parallel execution (MPI) <example parallel execution (MPI)>`.

.. _Why can you not use the step as a unique identifier?:

Why can you not use the step as a unique identifier?
----------------------------------------------------

There are two reasons. Firstly, |nmag| may be extended in future to
support effective energy minimisation in which case the ``step``
becomes somewhat meaningless (although it could probably still be used
as an identifier if we identify minimisation iterations with
steps). Secondly (and more importantly), in |nmag|, the user can modify
the magnetisation directly using :ref:`set_m` (either scripted or
interactively). This will change the configuration of the system
without increasing the step counter of the time integrator. For this
reason, we have the :ref:`unique identifier id <unique identifier id>`.

.. _How to generate a mesh with more than one region using GMSH?:

How to generate a mesh with more than one region using GMSH?
------------------------------------------------------------

To assign different material properties to different objects, the mesher needs to assign different region number to different simplices of the mesh. The manual shows how to do this for netgen (see :download:`two_cubes.geo <example_two_materials/two_cubes.geo>`) file in example :ref:`Example: two different magnetic materials <example two different magnetic materials>`). 

How does one define different regions using GMSH? User Xu Shu (Wuhan,
China) kindly provides this solution:

  Within GMSH, one has to firstly "add physical groups" and choose the
  two detached volumes separately to add them into different groups,
  then choose "edit" to redefine the number of the two groups, thus you
  can get two physical objects as you want.

.. _Can I run more than one simulation in one directory?:

Can I run more than one simulation in one directory?
----------------------------------------------------

If you want to run two (or more) simulations in the same directory,
then this is fine as well as long as they have different *simulation names*.
 
The simulation name is either the string given to the constructor of
the simulation object, or -- if no name is defined explicitly -- the
name of the python file that contains the simulation script (without
the ``.py`` extension). See :ref:`File names for data files` for a detailed
example for this. 
 
Data and log files will all start with the simulation name, followed
by some specific appended string and specific file extensions. It is
thus safe to run simulations with different names in the same
directory.



Can I save data to an arbitrary directory?
------------------------------------------

Do you really need to do so?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, consider whether you really need to save data in a different
directory. Remember that you can run many simulation with one single
script just using a different simulation name, like::

  ...
  s1 = Simulation('one')
  ...
  s2 = Simulation('two')
  ...


When you save the data for simulation ``one`` you get files like
``one_dat.h5`` and ``one_dat.ndt``, while when dealing with simulation ``two`` you get ``two_dat.h5`` and ``two_dat.nd5``. There is no interference
between the two simulations (and in particular it is necessary to save thedata in different directories.)

How to save data to a different directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you run a simulation script which saves data from a simulation,
the files are saved by default in the current working directory.  In
order to change this and save data into a directory called ``./mydir/``
you should start your script in the following way::


  import nmag
  import nsim.features
  fts = nsim.features.Features()
  fts.set('etc', 'savedir', './mydir/')
  ...
  ...


Alternatively, you can change the current working directory at the
beginning of the file with ordinary Python code::

  
  import os
  initial_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.curdir)
  os.chdir('./mydir')
  ...
  ...
  os.chdir(initial_dir)

If the directory you want to write to does not exist then (in both the
two example) you may have to create it first, with something like:

  the_dir = './mydir'
  import os
  if not os.path.exists(the_dir):
    os.mkdir(the_dir)



How to check the convergence of a simulation
--------------------------------------------


How long it takes to run a simulation? This depends very much on what
you are simulating and under what conditions (applied field, current,
etc). Sometimes, however, your simulation may not be ending as quickly as
you expected and you may want to check what is happening. It may be,
indeed, that the simulation is not converging, which means that it may
actually never end. One thing you can do in such a case is to take a
look at the file ``*_progress.txt``, where ``*`` stands for the simulation
name (given to the ``Simulation`` class when creating the simulation
oject). For example, if you created your simulation object with a line
such as::

  s = nmag.Simulation('one')

Then you may be looking for a file with name ``one_progress.txt``. If
you used simply ``s = nmag.Simulation()`` and your file is named
``two.py`` then you should look for a file with name
``two_progress.txt``. This file contains statistics about the time
integrator. You'll first get the current time, step number, etc. Then
you'll get a list of rows each containing four columns, such as::

  123 0.456 0.123 None

Column 1 is the step reached, an integer number which always
increases. The file shows convergence statistics for the last few
steps (it doesn't contain statistics for all the steps, since this
would make it quickly very big). Column 2 contains the current value
of max || dM/dt ||. Column 3 contains the stopping value of
dM/dt. Convergence is reached when column 2 < column 3 for at least
two times. If the simulations is going well, then you should see that
column 2 contains numbers which are not oscillating rapidly and are
rather decreasing or increasing "smoothly". This is what typically
should happen, even if it can be that your simulation has really a
bizarre dynamics which really oscillates in a frenetic way, so one
should be careful when analysing the data. The fourth column contains
an evaluation of the quality of the convergence according to what we
just said. This number should be close to one when the convergence is
smooth and close to zero when it is oscillating dramatically.

What to do in case of convergence problems
------------------------------------------

If your simulation has really a convergence problem, you can do two
things: 

* improve the tolerances ``ts_abs_err`` and ``ts_rel_err``
  (decrease these numbers) by using the method ``set_params`` of the
  ``Simulation`` object; 

* use a ``do=[('next_stage', at('stage_time',SI(x, 's')))]`` as an 
  argument to the ``hysteresis`` method. This way
  you impose a maximum time ``x`` to spend in the computation of a stage
  (you should make sure this makes sense in your case).
 

How to visualise the difference between two fields defined over the same mesh
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First save the data into two **ASCII** VTK files. For example::

  nmagpp --vtk=m.vtk --vtkascii --fields=m simulation_name

Note the option ``"--vtkascii"`` to force the creation of a ASCII file. 
Let's say this command created the two files ``m-000000.vtk`` and ``m-000001.vtk``.
You can now use the library ``pyvtk`` to load the two files, compute the difference and save it back to a third file::

  import numpy, pyvtk
  a = pyvtk.VtkData("m-000000.vtk")
  b = pyvtk.VtkData("m-000001.vtk")
  va = a.point_data.data[0].vectors
  vb = b.point_data.data[0].vectors
  for i in range(len(va)):
      va[i] = list(numpy.array(va[i]) - numpy.array(vb[i]))
  a.tofile("difference.vtk")

Save this text to a file named ``diff.py`` and run it as::

  python diff.py

You'll get a third file with name ``difference.vtk`` containing the difference of the two fields.

If you are repeating this operation many times, it may become annoying to open again and again the ``diff.py`` file to change the names of the input files. You can then modify the script as follows::

  import sys, numpy, pyvtk
  a = pyvtk.VtkData(sys.argv[1])
  b = pyvtk.VtkData(sys.argv[2])
  va = a.point_data.data[0].vectors
  vb = b.point_data.data[0].vectors
  for i in range(len(va)):
      assert a.structure.points[i] == b.structure.points[i]
      va[i] = list(numpy.array(va[i]) - numpy.array(vb[i]))
  a.tofile(sys.argv[3])

The name of the files are taken from the command line. You can then compute the difference using::

  python diff.py a.vtk b.vtk a_minus_b.vtk 

Notice that in the last version of the script we also added the line::

  assert a.structure.points[i] == b.structure.points[i]

which does just check that the two files are using the same set of points (i.e. the same mesh).


How to re-sample data from a saved h5 file
------------------------------------------

(Available in Nmag-0.2.0)

You can load an h5 file like this ::

  import ocaml
  from nmag.h5probe import Fields
  handler = Fields("infile.h5")
  field = handler.set_field_data("m", "Py", 0)

And probe one of its fields::

  position = [0, 1, 2] # In mesh units (typically is nanometres)
  value = ocaml.probe_field(field, "m_Py", position)[0][1]

This way you can create two arrays: ``rs`` containing an array of points and ``vs`` containing the corresponding values.
You can then use pyvtk to generate a VTK file from these::

  import pyvtk
  
  grid = pyvtk.UnstructuredGrid(rs)
  data = pyvtk.PointData(pyvtk.Vectors(vs))
  v = pyvtk.VtkData(grid, data)
  v.tofile("outfile.vtk")

Here is a full example, which probes the magnetisation in the outer skin of a cylinder, in sections which are not equally spaced.
Notice the usage of the function ``float_set`` to specify where the sampling should be denser (originally, here is where a domain wall was).
The script should be used as ``nsim probe.py infile.h5 outfile.vtk``::

  import math
  import sys
  
  import pyvtk
  
  import ocaml
  from nmag.h5probe import Fields
  from nmag import float_set
  
  # First we probe the field in the required points
  handler = Fields(sys.argv[1])
  field = handler.set_field_data("m", "Py", 0)
  
  xs = float_set([-150.0, -145.0, [], -15.0, -12.5, [], 15.0, 20.0, [], 50.0])
  angles = float_set([0, [20], 2*math.pi])
  R, R2 = (4.9, 5.1)
  
  rs = []
  vs = []
  for x in xs:
    for angle in angles:
      r = [x, R*math.cos(angle), R*math.sin(angle)]
      rs.append([x, R2*math.cos(angle), R2*math.sin(angle)])
      vs.append(ocaml.probe_field(field, "m_Py", r)[0][1])
  
  # Now we output the values to a VTK file
  grid = pyvtk.UnstructuredGrid(rs)
  data = pyvtk.PointData(pyvtk.Vectors(vs))
  v = pyvtk.VtkData(grid, data)
  v.tofile(sys.argv[2])



Notes on using GMSH to create a family of related meshes
--------------------------------------------------------

If you want to create many meshes using Gmsh, you may first generate a
mesh manually.  Then you can create a Python script which uses this
mesh as a template to quickly create a mesh for a different set of
parameters.  Below is such a script which shows how to do so. The mesh
file (geo) has been enclosed between quotes ``"""`` and some of the
values for the points coordinates have been substituted with strings
that the Python script substitutes with real values.

Note that we use ``Mesh.CharacteristicLengthFactor = 5.0;`` to control
the discretisation of the mesh. We also use ``Physical Volume(1) =
{1};`` to make sure that the mesh region is labeled starting from
region number 1::

  mesh = """
  cl1 = 1;
  Point(1) = {$x2$, 0, 0, cl1};
