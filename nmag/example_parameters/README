This example (unfinished) shows how to change the abs_tol and rel_tol
values as ude by sundials for the time integration.

It basically shows that we have a longer execution time, and more
iterations, the high we choose the tolerances.

This needs to be complemented with an option of modifying the accuracy
of the KSP solves as used to obtain the demag field. We still need to
add the relevant example here.

The timings for the three runs (on eta) were (only for the
advance_time loop):

bar_fast took 207 seconds
bar_noraml.py took 457 seconds 
bar_slow took 16194 seconds
