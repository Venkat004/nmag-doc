Example: Thermal Effects
------------------------

|nmag| supports the simulation of thermal effects by adding a
stochastically fluctuating field with proper variance to the effective
field, following "Micromagnetics and the Microstructure of
Ferromagnetic solids" (section 14.6) by [Kronmuller]_. This feature is
enabled by specifying a ``temperature`` when creating the Simulation_
object. Since the thermal noise renders |nmag|'s standard time
integrator sundials_ unusable, it is using a fixed time step and the
Heun method for the time integration
[Schrefl_IEEE_TransMag_36_3189]_. Another complication in these kind
of studies of thermal fluctuations is that the error of the time
integration cannot be reliably measured (as the stochastic noise
field is adding a stochastic term to the equations of motions) and
thus a dynamic adaption of the time step is impossible. Instead, one
needs to determine a fixed time step, and then run the simulation with
this (the timestep to be used is passed via the ``thermal_delta_t``
parameter to the Simulation_ object).

The same considerations and limitations of the stochastic simulation
of thermal effects apply to the OOMMF "thetaevolve" extension module
(available at
http://www.nanoscience.de/group_r/stm-spstm/projects/temperature/download.shtml).

Here we provide an example study of the dynamics of a thermally
assisted switching process. The geometry under investigation is a cube
with 8nm edge length. Here is a snap shot of the thermal fluctuations
of the magnetisation, which is on average aligned in the +z direction
but with small deviations in x and y due to a small temperature of 2K:

The zero temperature case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the figure above, we can see the geometry under consideration: a
cube of NdFeB with parameters Ms=1.6 Tesla/mu0, A=7.3e-12 J/m, and
uniaxial anisotropy constants K1= 4.3e6, J/m^3 and K2=0.65e6 J/m^3
(Parameters from [Kronmuller]_) with edge length 8nm in all three
directions. (We have set K2, which should have a small effect, to zero
to be able to carry out comparitive studies with OOMMF). The easy axis
is oriented in the [0.01,0.01,1] direction, *i.e.* along the z-axis
with a slight deviation to break the cubic symmetry. The applied field
is acting exactly in the z-direction.

Initially, we determine the field at which the magnetisation switches
from +z to -z without thermal fluctuations. Using nmag at 0K (*i.e.*
with the usual sundials_ time integrator), we find a switching field
of 4.94e6 A/m. This script `thermal-0K.py
<../example_thermal_cube/thermal-0K.py>`__ will repeat the calculation
(with a varying step size in the applied field) up to the switching
field:

.. include:: ../example_thermal_cube/thermal-0K.py
  :literal:

The hysteresis_ function takes this line::

   norm_list=[-1,-2, [], -4, -4.2, [], -4.9, -4.91, [], -4.94]

and will translate it to the magnitudes of the applied field of ``-1,
-2, -3, -4, -4.2, -4.4, -4.6, -4.8, -4.9, -4.91, -4.92, -4.93, -4.94``
(because the ``[]`` autoexpands into a sequence of the same step size
as the last step) in units of 10^6 A/m.

For every stage completed, the averages and field are saved due to this line::

  save=[('fields', 'restart', at('convergence'))]

We will come back to that when we extract the magnetisation at an
applied field of -4.92e6 A/m from the ``thermal-0K_dat.h5`` data file
that the ``thermal-0K.py`` script produces. 

Because the magnetisation is switching at 4.94e6 A/m, we expect that
it will not switch at a somewhat smaller value, say 4.92e6 A/m, but
that increasing the temperature will assist and enable this switching
process. This is what we will study in this example. 

The `mesh <../example_thermal_cube/cube.nmesh.h5>`__ we use has been created with Netgen_:

Choosing the time step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As outline in the introduction above, we need to choose a fixed time
step size. For the simulations shown here, we have chosen 1e-15s
(i.e. one femto second) as a compromise between accuracy (calling for
small time steps) and practicability (calling for large time
steps). The time step is in particular chosen such that when we
include the thermal fluctuations the max angle stays below 45 degrees
(see `Max angle requirements`_). We have found that for the
temperatures used in this example, this is the case for a time step of
1e-15s.

Finite temperatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We perform a simulation where the magnetisation is pointing up (*i.e.*
in the +z direction) and the applied field is pointing down. The
applied field is chosen to have a magnitude of 4.92e6 A/m which is
just below the switching field of 4.94e6A/m. We should find that the
switching process will take place at sufficiently high temperatures,
and that the switching is likely to take place the faster the higher
the temperature is.

For each simulation, we have chosen the initial magnetisation
configuration to be taken from the `The zero temperature case`_ at an
applied field of 4.92e6 A/m. We show one `script
<../example_thermal_cube/thermal-2K.py>`__ that carries out this
simulation at a temperature of 2K:

.. include:: ../example_thermal_cube/thermal-2K.py
  :literal:


We have carried out the simulation three times at 2K with different
random seeds (this is the ``user_seed_T`` argument in the constructor
of the Simulation_ object). We have carried out 3 further simulations
at 4K and one at 1K. The thermally assisted switching processes are
summarised in the next figure:


.. image:: ../example_thermal_cube/switching-field-4_92-nmag-netgen.png
  :align: center
  :width: 800
  :height: 600

It can be seen that 

 * the switching takes place the sooner the higher the temperature

 * for one temperature, there is some variation in the time when the actual 
   switching takes place (due to the stochastic nature of this 
   simulation technique).

We also show a snap shot of one of the reversal processes at 2K:
