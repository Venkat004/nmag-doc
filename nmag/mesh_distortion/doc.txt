Mesh distortion for edge roughness simulation
---------------------------------------------

The meshes used in micromagnetic simulations usually represent
idealized geometries (for example, a nanowire might be modeled using a
completely smooth cuboid mesh).  Real-world materials, on the other
hand, possess imperfections on various scales caused by fabrication
processes (e.g., electron beam lithography or sputter
deposition). This can potentially have a significant impact on the
magnetization dynamics.  The advantage of finite element-based
simulations is that such effects can be simulated (at least
qualitatively) by distorting the mesh in a suitable way. ``nmeshpp``
provides a means of distorting a given mesh in order to imitate
roughness so that the resulting effects on simulations can be
explored. Note that at the moment only edge roughness is supported.
We first present an example in the following section and then go into
the details of the command line interface and how the distortion
process works.
