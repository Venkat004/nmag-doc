Introduction
============

|Nmag| is a flexible finite element micromagnetic simulation
package with an user interface based on the 
Python_ programming language.

|Nmag| Philosophy
-----------------

Many specialized simulation codes used in research today
consist of a highly specialized core application which initially was
written to simulate the behaviour of some very specific
system. Often, the core application then evolved into a more broadly
applicable tool through the introduction of additional
parameters. Some simulation codes reach a point where it becomes
evident that they need an amount of flexibility that can only be
provided by including some script programming capabilities.

The approach underlying |Nmag| turns this very common pattern of
software evolution (which we also have seen in web browsers, CAD
software, word processors, etc) on its head: rather than gradually
providing more and more flexibility in an ad-hoc manner through adding
configuration parameters, slowly evolving into an extensive
specialized programming language, |Nmag| starts out as an extension to
a widely used programming language (Python_) from which it gains all its
flexibility and evolves towards more specialized notions to
conveniently define and study the properties of very specific physical
systems [#FischbacherEtAl1]_.

The main advantage of this approach is two-fold: first, we do not
gradually evolve another ad-hoc (and potentially badly implemented)
special purpose programming language. Second, by drawing upon the
capabilities of a well supported existing framework for flexibility,
we get a lot of additional power for free: the user can employ readily
available and well supported Python libraries for tasks such as data
post-processing and analysis, e.g. generating images for web pages
etc. In addition to this, some users may benefit from the capability
to use |Nmag| interactively from a command prompt, which can be very
helpful during the development phase of an involved simulation script [#FischbacherEtAl2]_.

The disadvantage is of course that a novice user may be confronted
with much more freedom than he can handle. We try to cope with this
issue by providing a collection of example scripts (in the :ref:`Guided
Tour`) for the most common applications that only need very slight
modification for basic use (e.g. changing of the mesh filename or
material parameters).

At present, |Nmag| is based on the Python programming language. This
seems to be a somewhat reasonable choice at present, as Python is
especially friendly towards casual users who do not want to be forced
to first become expert programmers before they can produce any useful
results. Furthermore, Python is quite widespread and widely supported
these days.

.. comment:

  As most of the underlying field theoretical foundations
  used by |Nmag| are derived from the low level |Nsim| multiphysics
  simulator which is not closely tied to Python, it would be possible to
  provide support for other scripting languages in the future should the
  need arise (e.g. in case Python should become unpopular over the
  years).

How to read this document
-------------------------

We suggest you follow the :ref:`Guided Tour` through a number of examples
to get a quick overview of what |nmag| looks like in real use, and to
see examples that can be used to carry out typical simulations. We
provide a number of skeletons that are easily adapted to specific
systems which show how to compute hysteresis loops, do energy
minimisation, or compute time evolution.

The :ref:`Command Reference` section explains the relevant commands
provided by |Nmag| in full detail. This should be especially useful to
advanced users who want to design sophisticated simulation scripts in
Python.

If you are new to micromagnetic modelling, you may want to start with
the :ref:`mini tutorial micromagnetic modelling`.

.. comment:

  |Nmag| is a relatively young piece of software. It almost certainly
  contains bugs and we encourage users to report these to the :ref:`nmag
  team <contact>`, so they can be document and fixed; assuming the
  resources for this are available.

  It is also very likely that parts of the user interface will change
  over time.  We will try to make changes backward compatible where this
  is feasible and acceptable.


  Some features do exist that have not been documented in the manual
  yet. This may be (i) because the nmag team has not found the time yet
  to create the documentation. However, it is also possible that (ii) we
  are still testing how a feature and its interface *feels* when being
  used, and we hesitate to document an interface if we consider it
  likely that it might be changed in the near future. Finally, (iii) we
  will not rush to publish any new functionality if we are not aware of
  any users who would be interested in this feature. For this reason, we
  do encourage users to contact the :ref:`nmag team <contact>` to suggest features
  that would be relevant to them. We are also interested in generic
  feedback (good and bad; ideally constructive).

  While we have only limited resources for the development and
  maintenance of the code and will therefore not be able to react
  immediately (or at all) to requests and suggestions, it is important
  that we maintain an up-to-date understanding of the requirements of
  the community.

The first Nmag release was late in 2007, and many bugs have been fixed
since then. Having said that, without doubt there are bugs left in the
system, and there is a long list of wishes for extra features,
changes, improvements. 

Currently, there is no significant amount of funding or man power
available to support Nmag users or develop it further. The software should
thus be seen to be provided as is.
